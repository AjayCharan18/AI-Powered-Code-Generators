give a code for chatbot.com.

I am using the code from the previous post, but the question is "how can I make it work on Linux?" I don't think there is a way for it to work in Windows, or even on the Mac. The best way I can think of is to put the command in a file called chat_bot_chat.sh and put it into the file as a script, and then it will be executed on a windows machine. Is there a place to do this?
Thanks in advance for your help. I will give it a try. Thanks!
Here's what it looks like:
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
   echo "Try it!"
fi
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
cd "$HOME"
chmod +x chat
echo "OK" | chmod 755 chat.bash_log
exit
